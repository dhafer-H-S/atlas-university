mid-term-project/ ├── AnswerKeys.txt ├── cards.txt ├── function.c ├── GradesTest.txt ├── main.c ├── output.txt ├── project.h ├── statistics.txt └── test.sh

## Files

- `AnswerKeys.txt`: Contains the answer keys for different booklet types.
- `cards.txt`: Contains the student data read from optical cards.
- `function.c`: Contains the implementation of functions to read data, calculate grades, and write outputs.
- `GradesTest.txt`: Output file containing the grades of the students.
- `main.c`: Contains the main function to run the project.
- `output.txt`: Contains the output of running the project, including error messages and the contents of `GradesTest.txt` and `statistics.txt`.
- `project.h`: Header file containing constants, structures, and function prototypes.
- `statistics.txt`: Output file containing statistics about the grades.
- `test.sh`: Script to compile and run the project.

## How to Run the Project


   Open a terminal and navigate to the `mid-term-project` directory:

   ```sh
   cd path/to/mid-term-project


## Ensure Input Files Exist

Make sure the AnswerKeys.txt and cards.txt files are present in the mid-term-project directory and contain the correct data format.

Run the Script

Run the test.sh script to compile and run the project:
In terminal run : bash test.sh


##Check the Outputs

The script will generate the following output files:

GradesTest.txt: Contains the grades of the students.
statistics.txt: Contains statistics about the grades.
output.txt: Contains the output of running the project, including error messages and the contents of GradesTest.txt and statistics.txt.
You can check the contents of these files to verify the results.
